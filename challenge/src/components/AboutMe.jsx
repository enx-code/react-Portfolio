        About Me
      </h5>
        Hello, I'm Enkhbat, a passionate front-end developer with a keen eye for
      detail and a love for technology. I recently completed a comprehensive
      front-end development bootcamp, where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, Node.js, Bootstrap and React. 
        I am dedicated to creating
      seamless and visually appealing user experiences. Attention to detail is
      at the forefront of my work, ensuring that every project I undertake is
      polished and user-friendly. My enthusiasm for technology extends beyond
      the screen, and I am always eager to explore new developments in the
      ever-evolving world of web development.
